## ma206distributions

The `ma206distributions` package allows you to easily visualize common
distributions for statistical and probabilistic analytics in ggplot2.
This package has been built along side its sister package
`ma206equations`. Both packages will be discussed here, but the source
code for `ma206equations` resides
[here](github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206equations). See also `ma206data`
[here](github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206data).

## Abstract

Mathematical fluency involves frequent use of probability distributions.
However, visualizing these distributions can be tedious. In a
well-defined statistics and probability curriculum, the set of
distributions to be mastered is known and limited. In such settings
having shortcuts to produce or ingest these distributions in analytic
software for display and analysis could be beneficial for students and
instructors alike. The goal of this project is to provide ready-to-use
and functions that will make it easier to engage computationally with
these distributions. We make these objects and functions available in
the R package `ma206distributions`. In this project we focus on
demonstrating new functionality might be used for educating about the
binomial and geometric distributions. In addition, we explore a new
syntactic approach to with random discrete variable distributions
(constructed distributions).

## Objectives

1.  Provide functions that return data frames relating outcomes and
    probabilities for binomial and geometric distributions
2.  Providing quick-viz *stamp* functions for binomial and geometric
    distributions (normal and t exist in ggxmean). *Wishlist: also think
    about rewrite for stamp\_normal (i.e.Â what should height
    distribution look like?)*
3.  Provide additional **dataframes** for ma206 that are probabilities
    from curriculum (probability problems in text book). These might be
    moved to ma206data package at some point.
4.  Provide interactive app which 1) demonstrates distribution
    characteristics, allowing easy manipulation of parameters 2)
    connects to new package functionality by quoting back code
    underlying the app.

### Objective \#1. provide data frames that relate outcomes and probabilities

#### The problem

Currently, students may use R as a calculator for quick computation of
probabilistic quantities. However, using existing methodologies may
divorce quantities from useful context.

For example, consider the question: What is the probability of rolling a
six exactly two times in eight die rolls.

Solving that problem with current toolbox might look like this.

``` r
dbinom(x = 2, size = 8, prob = 1/6)
```

``` 
   [1] 0.2604762
```

This solution is concise, but lacks context, and doesnâ€™t nicely parlay
to answer other related and adjacent questions.

We propose instead that a full set of paired outcomes and probabilities
be made available to students when asking this question via the
ma206distributions function `tidy_dbinom`. To answer the preceding
question, then, students would consult the table that they produce using
the function:

``` r
library(ma206distributions)
options(scipen = 8, digits = 3)
tidy_dbinom(single_trial_prob = 1/6, 8)
```

``` 
   # A tibble: 9 Ã— 4
     num_successes probability single_trial_prob num_trials
             <int>       <dbl>             <dbl>      <dbl>
   1             0 0.233                   0.167          8
   2             1 0.372                   0.167          8
   3             2 0.260                   0.167          8
   4             3 0.104                   0.167          8
   5             4 0.0260                  0.167          8
   6             5 0.00417                 0.167          8
   7             6 0.000417                0.167          8
   8             7 0.0000238               0.167          8
   9             8 0.000000595             0.167          8
```

ðŸ¤” Should `tidy_dbinom` be called something else? Maybe `dbinom_df` is
better? or `df_dbinom`? Are we part of a fad of calling everything
â€˜tidyâ€™ and it not meaning much? ðŸ™ƒ

ðŸ¤” ðŸš§ Would the single\_trial\_prob and num\_trials columns be more
appropriately stored as meta data? How would be best to do that. Source
code
[here](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206distributions/blob/main/R/dbinom_df.R)

ðŸ¤” ðŸš§ Is there a way to avoid printing the row number in this .Rmd
rendering? this feels confusing because were are off by just an index of
one from num\_successes. Within an interactive session, the row numbers
donâ€™t show up and distract which is good.

Consulting the table, the students would find the â€˜2 successesâ€™ outcome
and find the associated probability of .260\!

And they can consult the same table to answer a number of additional
questions about the same scenario. What is the probability of rolling a
six only one time? Zero sixes? What is the probability of rolling two
successes (sixes) or fewer?

If students are interested in a more visual presentation, they might
also use the distribution combined with the ggplot2 plotting system,
which uses data frame inputs. To complement the probabilistic work, the
ma206distributions package also contains the `geom_lollipop()` function
to display the outcome-probability pairing via the â€˜lollipopâ€™ chart
which is popular for visualizing discrete distributions. Furthermore,
the ma206distributions package also contains the `scale_x_counting()`
function which ensures that tick marks and numerical values are provided
at the counting values of x, the support of the distribution.

``` r
library(ma206distributions)
library(tidyverse)
tidy_dbinom(single_trial_prob = 1/6, num_trials = 10) %>%   # from ma206distributions
  ggplot() + 
  labs(title = "Rolling a die 10 times: \nProbabilities of rolling 0 sixes, 1 six, 2 sixes,...10 sixes") +
  aes(x = num_successes, 
      y = probability) + 
  geom_lollipop(annotate = T) +           # from ma206distributions
  scale_x_counting()                      # from ma206distributions
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

The package ma206data also gives you a `stamp` shortcut data
visualization layer, used in the following manner. This method might be
used by instructors and students alike who are comfortable with the
distributionâ€™s underpinnings.

ðŸš§ In website pkgdown version of this, why is pkgdown failing to deliver

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- --> ðŸš§ Why isnâ€™t
annotate (labeling option) working in stamp\_dbinom()? See source code

[here](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206distributions/blob/main/R/geom_lollipop.R).

### including relevant equations

A complementary package, ma206equations exists that can deliver relevant
equations as a part of the distributional plots. Students and
instructors can stamp down the equation to calculate a probability in
the binomial distribution, as well as the choose equation if they need
that unpacked.

``` r
library(ma206equations)
ggplot() + 
  stamp_dbinom(single_trial_prob = 1/6, 
               num_trials = 10) +    # from ma206distributions
  scale_x_counting()  +
  stamp_eq_binomial(x = 7, 
                    y = .25,
                    size = 8) +
  stamp_eq_choose(x = 7, y = .2, 
                  size = 3, color = "black")
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

ðŸš§ We should probably be including left hand side of the equation for
stamp\_eq\_binomial. See equations spreadsheet
[here](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206equations/blob/main/data-raw/ma389_stats_formulas.csv)
.

## Functions to engage with the geometric distribution

#### tidy\_dgeometric

Similarly, geometric distributions might be delivered as a data frame.
Currently, students might use the base R function dgeom() to answer the
question about the probability that a trial is the first success
observed in a series of trials. For example: Given the probability of
free throw success of 2/3 for a given player, what is the probability
that weâ€™ll see the first success only upon the third attempt?

Currently, students might answer this question using R to calculate this
quantity.

``` r
dgeom(x = 3-1, prob = 2/3)
```

``` 
   [1] 0.0741
```

However, again the quantity returned lacks context. The
ma206distributions package provides a function to instead deliver a data
frame where attempt index and probability is paired as follows:

``` r
library(ma206distributions)
tidy_dgeometric(single_trial_prob = 2/3, 
                num_attempts = 5)
```

``` 
   # A tibble: 5 Ã— 4
     observed_attempt single_trial_prob probability cumulative_prob
                <int>             <dbl>       <dbl>           <dbl>
   1                1             0.667     0.667             0.667
   2                2             0.667     0.222             0.889
   3                3             0.667     0.0741            0.963
   4                4             0.667     0.0247            0.988
   5                5             0.667     0.00823           0.996
```

ðŸ¤” ðŸš§ Would the single\_trial\_prob columns be more appropriately stored
as meta data? How would be best to do that? Source code
[here](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ma206distributions/blob/main/R/dbinom_df.R)

Students can focus on the information in question, but also see that it
sits in the context of the larger probability distribution. \[For the
geometric distribution, it should be noted that the complete
distribution cannot be displayed as the â€˜supportâ€™ is infinite;
theoretically you could wait forever for the first success.\]

Students can easily feed the data frame produced with tidy\_dgeometric()
into a visualization software. The function `theme_axis_x_truncated`
helps us communicate that we arenâ€™t visualizing the full distribution
(which extends to infinity).

``` r
library(ma206distributions)
library(tidyverse)
tidy_dgeometric(single_trial_prob = 2/3, num_attempts = 5) %>%   # from ma206distributions
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = observed_attempt, 
      y = probability) + 
  geom_lollipop(annotate = T) +           # from ma206distributions
  scale_x_counting()  +                        # from ma206distributions
  labs(title = "Basketball hot shot: \nProbability that we'll see the first shot made only observed upon attempt 1, 2, 3, 4 ...",
       subtitle = "The probability of a success in individual shot is 2/3") + 
  theme_axis_x_truncated() + 
  stamp_eq_geometric(x = 4, y = .45)
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

ðŸ¤” We are inconsistent with naming, abbreviating to binom but not to
geom, from geometric? This is kind of motivated by the use of â€˜geomâ€™ in
ggplot2 in a totally different sense. What should we do?

ðŸ¤” ðŸš§ I think we are being inconsistent about geometric distribution
between ma206equations and ma206distributions. We can either count last
failure or first success.

And the function stamp\_dgeometric also exists as a shortcut for
displaying the distribution.

``` r
ggplot() + 
  stamp_dgeometric() + 
  scale_x_counting() + 
  theme_axis_x_truncated()
```

## given probability distribution as data frames.

## 3\. Tidying data from discrete random variable probability problems

Tidying up data is important so that when the data is inputted into R or
any coding language. This process of â€˜tidyingâ€™ data creates a
well-organized and structured format that is easier for data analysis
and visualization.

Probability tables are often communicated in â€˜untidyâ€™, *wide* forms not
easily ingested by statistical software. (another example:
<http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/ranvar.htm#>:\~:text=A%20discrete%20random%20variable%20is,then%20it%20must%20be%20discrete)
For example, the table was provided for a probability problem about a
spinning wheel with pie sectors with various prize award amounts:

|              |          |        |        |
| :----------- | :------- | :----- | :----- |
| sector\_type | No Prize | Win $1 | Win $3 |
| frequency    | 9        | 1      | 2      |

Such a spin-wheel might look like this:

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

To get the data into a tidy, ready-to-use form, we transposed the table
from wide to long so that a variable is a columns and the column headers
inform us about the content. This way, each row forms an observation, in
this case an event type. The spinning of the prize wheel has three
outcomes based on which sector type the wheel landed on: no prize, win
$1, and win $3. We added a numeric column â€˜payoutâ€™ too which we makes
the data easier to use from a mathematical standpoint. Below is our
tidied data.

ðŸš§ \[insert link to tidy data paper\]

| sector\_type | frequency | payout |
| :----------- | --------: | -----: |
| No Prize     |         9 |      0 |
| Win $1       |         1 |      1 |
| Win $3       |         2 |      3 |

In our package we include the data structured in this way in an object
called `prize_wheel`:

``` r
library(ma206distributions)
print(prize_wheel)
```

``` 
     sector_type frequency payout
   1    No Prize         9      0
   2      Win $1         1      1
   3      Win $3         2      3
```

Give that the data is tidied, we can easily visualize the joint
distribution of payout and frequency using the ggplot2 tool that is
already used heavily in the statistics part of the class.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
prize_wheel %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = payout) + 
  aes(y = frequency) +
  geom_lollipop()
```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- --> The function
`geom_fulcrum` can be used to visualize the balancing point of the data,
which is also the expected value. Then using the
`stamp_eq_expected_value`, `stamp_eq_variance`, and
`stamp_eq_standard_deviation`, we can relay the mathematical formulaâ€™s
for computing quantities about this distribution.

``` r
last_plot() +
  aes(weight = frequency) +
  geom_fulcrum(color = "red", 
               shape = 2, size = 5) + 
  stamp_eq_expected_value(x = 2, y = 7) + 
  stamp_eq_variance(x = 2, y = 6) +
  stamp_eq_standard_deviation(x = 2, y = 5) 
```

## A comparison with the status quo

The following code is what might be use if the ma206distributions and
ma206equations functions are not used.

The equations in the plot were produce in the following fashion (no
functions or package pre-built):

![{{\_N}C{\_k}} \*

``` r

```

``` 
      LaTeX: ${{_N}C{_k}} \cdot p^kq^{N-k}$ 
   plotmath: {{{}[N]}*C * {{}[k]}} %.% p^{k}*q^{N - k}
```

``` r
single_trial_prob <- .5
num_trials <- 10

0:num_trials ->
  possible_outcomes
 
dbinom(x = possible_outcomes,
       size = 10,
       prob = single_trial_prob) ->
  probs

tibble(possible_outcomes, probs) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = possible_outcomes) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = possible_outcomes) +
  aes(y = probs) +
  geom_point(fill = "white") +
  aes(xend = possible_outcomes,
      yend = 0) +
  geom_segment() +
  labs(subtitle = "Course idea #0: For multiple trials, the probability of a certain number of successes..." %>%
         str_wrap(60),
       x = "Number of Successes in 10 trials",
       y = "Probability") +
  geom_text(aes(label = probs %>% round(4)),
            nudge_y = .01) + 
    annotate(geom = "text",
    x = 1.5,
    y = .2,
    label = "{{{}[N]}*C * {{}[k]}} %.% p^{k}*q^{N - k}",
    parse = TRUE,
    size = 5) ->

```

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

detail for the interested: Another possibility is using the
`stat_function()` function in ggplot2 to produce visualizations of a
binomial distribution. Below, we show how you can visualize the binomial
distribution for 20 trials and .2 is the probability of success for each
trial. Using the `stat_function()` carefully, you can get a similar
outcome. However, there is a lot of coordination thatâ€™s required: `20`
shows up about three times in the construction for example in xlim(); in
`n = 21` (20 + 1 possible outcomes); and finally in the `args` list.
Producing this plot requires a lot of foreknowledge. With our
alternative strategies, (delivering data frames and stamps), we hope to
give students something they can produce easily, and *then* have a
conversation about why the distribution has the form it does.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  xlim(0, 20) +
  stat_function(fun = dbinom,
                geom = "point", 
                n = 21,
                args = list(size = 20, prob = .2)) + 
  labs(y = "Probability") + 
  labs(x = "Number of successes in 20 trials") + 
  labs(title = "Given 20 trials where the probability for success in a single\n trial is .2, what are the probabilities for each possible\nnumber of observed successes ")

## Visualizing a Discrete Random Variable without {ma206distributions} functions

Probability problems could be structured as data frames visualized with
the same tools used in the stats part of the class.

            vjust = -.5, color = "black") + 
  annotate(geom = "point", x = sum(c(.01*20000, .09*5000)),

# Architechture we will use

### How do we bundle up our work into concept-sized usable bits? Functions.

### How do we bundle up related functions? Packages.

  - We will still follow the steps outlined in this data package readme:
    <https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/tidytitanic>
  - As well as consult the package building guide:
    <https://evamaerey.github.io/package_in_20_minutes/package_in_20_minutes>

### How do we collaborate and share the package? Version Controlâ€¦

  - create a github account for collaboration <https://github.com/>
  - weâ€™ll make the repository available in this account
